Hello dear friends from Mandu üòÅ
## About the project

This project is based in Laravel, React and Redux. It is a simple project to show how to use the technologies. I tried to make it as simple as possible. I hope you enjoy it. üòÅ

## Installation and configuration

After clone the project, you need to install the dependencies wiwh (composer install). Make sure you have the latest version of composer. Then you have to configure your .env file with the database credentials.
After that you have to install a package dependencies with (npm install).
Once you have all the dependencies installed, you have to run the database migration with (php artisan migrate) and run the seeder with (php artisan db:seed).
If you want to run the server, you have to run the server with (php artisan serve) and is recommended to run it in other console with (npm run watch).

## Unit testin

To run the unit testing, you have to run the test with (vendor/bin/phpunit --filter DivisionTest).
When you run the test, you have to make sure that the row has been created,updated and deleted in the database.
With this test I made sure that the division CRUD is working correctly.

## TODOS

I tried to make the project as simple as possible, but I have to improve it. There are some TODOs in the code. There are some details that I have to add.
but it is not a big project, so I will try to improve it.
